1. load the data
2. shape of data
3. drop redundant columns or columns with many NaN entries or nonsense columns(like name/id)
4. identify which columns r quantitative and which categorical
5. replace NaN values by median in case of quantitative and mode in case of categorical features
6. plot hist of dependent variable vs the hypothesized features
7. select features that affect the dependent variable the most by using corr
8. label-encode/get-dummies on categorical columns
9. see if the features form normal distributions, if not, apply some transformation like sq. root or log to normalize them
10. standard scale the features
11. repeat 8 on dependent variable too
12. fit and train model
13. predict
14. apply some eval metric (rmse)
